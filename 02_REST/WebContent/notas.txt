 Run you web application in Eclipse and test the availability of your REST service under: 
 "http://localhost:8080/de.vogella.jersey.todo/rest/todos". 
 You should see the XML representation of your Todo items.

To see the count of Todo items use "http://localhost:8080/de.vogella.jersey.todo/rest/todos/count" 
to see an exiting todo use "http://localhost:8080/de.vogella.jersey.todo/rest/todos/{id}", 
e.g. "http://localhost:8080/de.vogella.jersey.todo/rest/todos/1" to see the todo with ID 1. 
We currently have only todos with the id's 1 and 2, all other requests will result an HTTP error code.

Please note that with the browser you can only issue HTTP GET requests. 
The next chapter will use the jersey client libraries to issue get, post and delete.
